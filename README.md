Here are the requirements:

- 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer).
- The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move.
- You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.

## Context

Tic-tac-toe, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
